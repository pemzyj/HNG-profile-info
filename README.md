# HNG-profile-info
A simple RESTful API endpoint that returns my profile information along with a dynamic cat featched from an external API
Setup:
1.	For this project, I used Node.js/Express.
2.	To start the project, I initialized node package manager (npm) using command ‘npm init’ 
3.	Install express.js and nodemon as dev dependency to automatically restart server after changes.
4.	In the package.json file, include “type”:”module” to use ES modules command

How to run locally:
1.	In the CLI, enter npm run dev to run the server.
2.	You should see server running on http:localhost://8080/me in your terminal
3.	Open the URL in your browser to access the endpoint.

Dependencies:
1.	Express.js: install with npm install express
2.	Nodemon: install with npm install -D nodemon to install as a dev dependency
